# resizable_mondrian
A take on Jen Simmon's [CSS grid Mondrian](https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/01-011D.html).
You can resize the blocks of a Mondrian-esque composition and they will snap reposition themselves through the magic of `grid-auto-flow: dense;`. Just open `index.html` on your browser of choice, allow JS execution and have fun dragging around the colored blocks.

This was thrown together on a couple of days for me to get the hang of CSS grid.
